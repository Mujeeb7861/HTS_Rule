# HTS\_Rules 🧪📊

**Rule-Based Heuristic System for Pre-Encryption Ransomware Behavior Detection**

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a rule-based heuristic system designed to detect *pre-encryption ransomware behavior* using Host-based Telemetry Signals (HTS). It focuses on analyzing behavioral indicators from ransomware families and applies filtering rules to identify suspicious activity before encryption occurs.

The detection logic is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`HTS_Rules.ipynb`), which processes the telemetry dataset and applies handcrafted rules to differentiate between benign and malicious activities.

## 🧠 Key Features

* ✅ **Rule-based Heuristic Detection** of ransomware before encryption
* 📂 **Event Categorization** based on behavioral signals
* 📊 **Scoring System** for suspicious behavior (Entropy, Rename, Create, Delete, Modify)
* 📌 **Threshold-based Classification** to identify pre-encryption activity
* 🧪 Supports dynamic behavioral analysis for malware research

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HTS_Rules.git
cd HTS_Rules
```

## ⚙️ Detection Workflow

  Load Telemetry Dataset** (CSV format)
  Apply Predefined Behavioral Rules:**

   * High entropy file creation
   * Frequent renaming patterns
   * File deletions/modifications in burst
  Score Assignment** per event
  Threshold Evaluation** to classify as ransomware or benign

---

## 📈 Output

* CSV or DataFrame showing:

  * Classified labels (Benign, Ransomware)
  * Matched rules
  * Final suspicion score
* Optional: Graphical analysis of events over time

---

## 📚 Research Context

This system was developed as part of a research study on *early detection of ransomware* using host-based behavioral signals. It aims to complement existing dynamic analysis techniques by focusing on the **pre-encryption phase**, allowing better prevention and response.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for academic and research use only. It does not provide guaranteed protection against ransomware in production environments. Always test with sandboxed or synthetic data when experimenting.
